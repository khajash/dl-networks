# Deep Learning Network Implementations
This repo will have various deep learning network implementations and data loaders. The networks will cover a handful of models for image classification, generative networks, and reinforcement learning. I use PyTorch for networks/training and am logging metrics using Weights and Biases.  

## Datasets
- **Classification:** 
    - [Imagenette](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette) - For testing networks and training at home on my old machine, this is great to play around with. It's a small subset of Imagenet (only 10 classes) and has full resolution images. 

## Networks
-  **Classification:**
    - AlexNet
    - VGG
